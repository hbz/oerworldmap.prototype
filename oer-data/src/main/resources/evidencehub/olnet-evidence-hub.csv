Because of the rapidly changing nature of the subject, it is often a challenge for us to keep our teaching up to date. For example, 10 years ago it might have made sense to teach science students how to prepare a glass histology slide for viewing with a microscope. Today, slides are often prepared automatically by large-scale laboratory equipment.

Science and technology subjects:-
So called STEM subjects &#40;science, technology, engineering and mathematics&#41; are exiting areas of study and graduates possess skills and knowledge sought after by a wide range of employers. So, finding good quality resources to support teaching is essential in order for tutors and lecturers to keep their material up to date. Also, finding good quality science teaching resources on the internet can save a tutor time in preparing basic material. There will be thousands of education establishments around the world teaching the anatomy of the heart for example, and so there will be thousands of nearly identical sets of learning materials written by tutors for their students. Surely we could work together to share materials more effectively?

Sharing with open education:-
Open education is a growing global concept where people are increasingly sharing their science teaching resources. These so called open educational resources &#40;OERs&#41; are existing learning resources that are then published with an open license such as Creative Commons which gives anyone permission to use the material. How amazing is that! There is an abundance of OER on the internet now and the challenge is finding it. In the US, there are organisations such as MIT and repositories such as MERLOT which excel in OER. In the UK, the national repository is JORUM. But the joy of open education is that no matter where you are in the world, you can access OER from other countries.

What to look for in a good resource:-
For a good quality science teaching resource three things are essential. 1&#41; The item must be up to date. 2&#41; The author must be a credible and authoritative. 3&#41; The resource must be open licensed. Hopefully the OER will be clearly stamped with this information.

What do students like?:-
Many science teaching resources are used by tutors and lecturers as a supplement to their face-to-face teaching in the classroom or lecture theatre. Students particularly like video and animation, and actually a combination of graphics or images with a voice over makes a very effective teaching aid. The open license should permit you to reuse the resource in lectures or on your course website, and many allow you to adapt and rewrite the resource too.

As a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization involving key leaders from all levels of the education system, ECS creates unique opportunities to build partnerships, share information and promote the development of policy based on available research and strategies.

Forty-nine states, three territories and the District of Columbia constitute the commission's current membership. Each member state or territory is represented by seven commissioners -- the governor and six other individuals, typically legislators, chief state school officers, state and local school board members, superintendents, higher education officials and business leaders.

The chairmanship and vice chairmanship of ECS are held by a governor and a state legislator, respectively, alternating between the two major political parties. Each chairman selects a particular issue that serves as a focal point for the organization's work during his or her term.

Various committees and work groups, made up of ECS commissioners, govern investment decisions, oversee the budget and guide the work of ECS. The ECS staff, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, includes educators, policy analysts, communications and technology experts, researchers and support staff. Three operating divisions work together to provide state leaders with the services and products they need to make informed education policy decisions. These divisions are Information Management and ECS Clearinghouse, Policy Studies, and Programs and State Services.

ECS is supported financially by a combination of state fees and contracts, sponsorships, and grants from foundations, corporations and the federal government. Among the funders of current ECS projects and initiatives are: Learn & Serve America (CNCS), AED (NCLC), International Step by Step, Colorado Service Learning Trail Guide, Tennessee â€“ FIPSE, GE (Progress of Ed Reform), State Farm, KnowledgeWorks (Economic Development) and Lumina (Student Services).",0,,,1308048825,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,"Denver, Colorado",US,39.73915,-104.9847,Organization1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+29,http://oertn.eun.org/node/2,1301414468,http://oertn.eun.org/node/2,0,,,1301414468,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1.37108E+31,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://http://www.ecs.org,1308048826,http://http://www.ecs.org,0,,,1308048826,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,U.S. P.I.R.G.,1308059939,"The US Public Interest Research Group (also known as PIRG) is a political lobby non-profit organization in the United States and Canada, composed of self-governing affiliates at the state and province level.

* The conditions necessary for delivering high-quality instructional materials for a lower investment; and

* The technical, social, and policy implications of replacing traditional textbooks with digital alternatives.

The term copyright refers to laws that govern the use of the work of an author or creator. Copyright is part of what is generally referred to as intellectual property rights, where exclusive rights are granted to the author or creator of an original work (such as literary, scientific and artistic works) , including the right to print, display, distribute/sell, copy and adapt the work.

All works are governed by copyright, whether this is explicitly stated or not.

Why is copyright needed?

Conventional copyright licences are a way for copyright holders to take ownership of their work and possibly to earn money from works in which they have copyright.

Associated with this are moral rights which are the authorâ€™s right to be recognised as the author, the right to the integrity of the work and the right not to have the work adapted, modified or distorted in a way that would lessen the authorâ€™s reputation. Moral rights may be waived or transferred in some jurisdictions, and what they comprise varies by jurisdiction. Moral rights can also pass through by inheritance.

Together we can make change happen.

It's a good thing, too. Our generation has some big challenges to tackle - from global warming to the rising cost of college, from homelessness to our collapsing health care system. It won't be easy, but by acting together we can find solutions.

That's where we come in. Here at the Student PIRGs (Public Interest Research Groups), we organize college students to solve some of the world's most pressing public interest problems.

The PIRGs are independent statewide student organizations that work on issues like environmental protection, consumer protection, and hunger and homelessness. For nearly 40 years students with their campus PIRG chapters have been making a real difference in people's lives and winning concrete changes to build a better world.

In the 18 months since the launch, Beyond Textbooks has scrutinized cost-effective models that blend the vetted standards-based content and convenience of traditional textbooks with the engaging, dynamic, up-to-date content and resources afforded by the Web. The goals of the pilot project have been to understand:
How digital instructional materials can be used most effectively to increase student engagement and educational outcomes and to improve teacher practice;
The conditions necessary for delivering high-quality instructional materials for a lower investment; and
The technical, social, and policy implications of replacing traditional textbooks with digital alternatives.
While the authors of the Virginia study correctly point out that the effort is only a pilot, increased student independence and increased engagement were noted by students and teachers. And, researchers observed that the studentsâ€™ comfort levels with the e-books allowed teachers more freedom to become facilitators of learning.

    * Excellence: We are dedicated to achieving the highest standards in teaching, research, scholarship and student service.
    * Openness: We are committed to our mission of guaranteeing access to post-secondary learning to all who have the ability and desire. If you are 16 or older, you are eligible for admission to undergraduate study.

But the processes change. Scientists demand more transparency and new approaches to overcome delays caused by the peer-review bottleneck that, in spite of digitalization, grows worse. Exponentially growing literature, globalized research, hyperspecialized research with fewer expert referees, a shorter research-to-written-paper delay, a more competitive environment, and fewer independent expert referees available contribute to delays, pointed out Bernd Pulverer, head of scientific publications at the European Molecular Biology Organization &#40;EMBO&#41; and chief editor of its journal.

In 2009, EMBO instituted a transparent electronic peer-reviewing process using Web 2.0 technologies. The software handles referee reports, editor communications, author rebuttals, and timelines and supports the management tasks with handling statistics. Since September 2010, the new peer-review process has been inaugurated at all EMBO publications.

While EMBO uses Web 2.0 technology to advance the traditional peer-reviewing processes and make them more transparent, a radical step is being prepared by a pan-European group of researchers. Funded by the EU and coordinated by the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Trento in Italy, they have developed â€œan entirely new dissemination model and website where scientific communication meets the social web,â€ù says Maurizio Marchese, a member of the team of scientists. The scientists call it Liquid Publications, designed to â€œhelp you to stumble upon what you need.â€ù The group suggests that scientists should not submit their articles to be published in a journal but instead share it on the LiquidPub website &#40;http://liquidpub.org&#41;. This includes data sets, presentation slides, and other presentations.

To rank the articles, the scientists will look at how people are using these materials. They have developed new metrics and methods to analyze usage. The procedureâ€”post the articles unreviewed and then analyze readersâ€™ behaviorsâ€”is intended to substitute traditional peer reviewing and bring forth a system in which citation counts can be replaced by the use ranking. Marchese thinks this is â€œa knowledge dissemination system that better fits into the web era.â€ù &quot;",0,,,1329325982,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Claim1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Coalitions who collaborate on textbook content can experience greater academic freedom,1328791868,"&quot;A Creative Commons textbook initiative may not only save students money, it could also give faculty more freedom to customize the content of their courses.&quot;",0,,,1328791868,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Claim1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/how-sopa-affects-students-and-educators,1329758059,"How SOPA Affects Students, Educators, and Libraries",0,,,1329758059,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://www.web2rights.com/OERIPRSupport/howopenareyou/,1329313163,Web2Rights - How Open Are You?,0,,,1329313163,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Going the Distance: Online Education in the USA  (2011),1321891691,"Allen, I. and Seaman, J.

In specific, COL encourages the development and sharing of open learning/distance education knowledge, resources and technologies.

COL recognises and promotes OER as central to its agenda of learning for development. COL has adopted the widest definition of Open Education Resources (OER) as â€˜materials offered freely and openly to use and adapt for teaching, learning, development and researchâ€™. While OER are mainly shareable in digital formats (both online and via offline formats such as DVD or CD-ROM), COL sees OER not just synonymous with online resources, online learning or e-learning, and within the development context COL is working, OER can also be in printable formats.

The Commonwealth of Learning:

* facilitates collaboration among institutions, governments and organisations in the use of OER;

* promotes relevant capacity strengthening processes for stakeholders; and

* shapes and promotes new models for OER generation, publication, access and re-use.

* encourage and support governments and institutions to establish supportive policy frameworks to introduce practices relating to OER;

One reason, on top of the bureaucracy that companies have to deal with: the digital infrastructure in many K-12 schools is weak, with an average of three students for every device as well as more mundane problems like too few electrical outlets.

That said, thereâ€™s clearly some real opportunity: While many assume the K-12 market is largely controlled by the three big companies that Apple is partnering with, in fact, more than half of that $8 billion market isnâ€™t.&quot;

They also keep their content updated on a regular basis, which, among other things, means replacing each course from scratch after eight years. In other words, the UKOU currently spends around $75 million per year on content development, which amounts to around 40 percent of their budget.

While generic web analytics tend to focus on easily harvested quantitative data, Learning Analytics will often seek qualitative understanding of the context and meaning of this information. This is critical in the case of dialogue, which may be employed to share knowledge and jointly construct understandings, but which also involves many superficial exchanges. Previous studies have validated a particular pattern of â€œexploratory dialogueâ€ù in learning environments to signify sharing, challenge, evaluation and careful consideration by participants. This study investigates the use of sociocultural discourse analysis to analyse synchronous text chat during an online conference. Key words and phrases indicative of exploratory dialogue were identified in these exchanges, and peaks of exploratory dialogue were associated with periods set aside for discussion and keynote speakers. Fewer individuals posted at these times, but meaningful discussion outweighed trivial exchanges. If further analysis confirms the validity of these markers as learning analytics, they could be used by recommendation engines to support learners and teachers in locating dialogue exchanges where deeper learning appears to be taking place.",0,,,1314893438,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Open Course Library,1313411023,"The Open Course Library is about building and sharing quality, educational materials so more people can access and succeed in higher education.

This paper provides an overview of emerging activity patterns on Cloudworks, a specialised site for sharing and debating ideas as well as resources on teaching, learning and scholarship in education. It provides an overview of activities such as 'flash debates', 'blended workshops' and 'open reviews' and seeks to situate dialogic interchanges and structures of involvement within the following theoretical frameworks: a) Goffman's notions of 'face-work' and 'ritual performanceÃ¯Â¿Â_; and b) and secondly, notions of collective intelligence. The paper argues that these perspectives can offer a unique contribution to the study and analysis of sociality (Bouman et al, 2007) bounded in the context of technologically mediated networked learning, with wider implications for understanding matters of participation, self-representation, reflection and expansion in education.",0,,,1314890048,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,"USA's First Interactive Web 2.0 Open Source Textbook Free to Students Through For-Profit Giant, Nonprofit Team",1318252068,"Collaborative Statistics, 2nd Edition, was written and updated by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean, faculty members at De Anza College in Cupertino, California.

have insufficient data to identify those in the greatest need. Interdisciplinary searches are also problematic.

* Technical and implementation issues. The following are all likely to deter would-be users of OER: poorly indexed materials, inadequate search engines, the requirement to
register with a site or download an application in order to retrieve or run a resource, and unreliable hardware or software on the hosting site.

Discoverability. This issue stems largely from low volume, poor indexing and the low power of some search engines. It can be mitigated to some extent where teachers are part
of a community and can benefit from word-of-mouth recommendations, but could prove a major stumbling block where teachers are working on their own, without the
support of others.

In: Media Literacy Conference, 19-20 Nov 2010, Institute of Education, London.

Several scholars have addressed the centrality of media and internet literacy within what is commonly known as participatory media culture (e.g. Jenkins, 2006). For some, integration of social media within tertiary and post-tertiary curricula promises an unprecedented pedagogical potential, particulary focusing on peer-to-peer learning, cultural agency and digital creativity skills. Engagement with social media in an educational context, is influenced by several factors, including cultural perceptions regarding â€˜learningâ€™ and â€˜informationâ€™, 'informal' and 'accredited'; perceptions regarding the value of resources and evaluation of information, but also competences involving critical reflection and communicative or negotiation skills (Livingstone, 2008; Metzer and Flanagin, 2008; Rieh and Hilligoss, 2008). Also important are the tensions associated with the blurring boundaries between production and use, ownership and authorship, expert authority and amateur creativity, openness and completeness, as well as formal and informal learning (e.g. James et al, 2008; McPherson, 2008). As educational instituions turn from transmission to more dialogic models in the production of learning materials, the discussion of media literacy can be further contextualised.

Based on an extensive review of the evidence-based literature on the pedagogical uses of social media in higher education in four OECD countries, and an empirical investigation of volunteer 'learner-students' and 'learner-teachers' interacting in two non-formal, open educational contexts, the paper offers a workable typology of literacies focusing on: a) social and situated practices (including meaning making and situated cognition); b) technological and media literacies in creating, interpretting and reusing materials (including multimodal skills, information and critical literacy); c) and scaffolded and metacognitive literacies (including the pedagogies associated with mediated learning). It argues that while the discussion of media literacy is well situated within discourses and practices on life-long and self-directed learning, novel tensions surrounding the boundaries of self-representation, credit and expertise in digital spaces, make the implementation of learning literacies for the digital age more complex.",0,,,1314798013,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://www.cloudworks.ac.uk,1314806735,http://www.cloudworks.ac.uk,0,,,1314806735,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,OER Discoverability â€“ Top Tips for Search Engine Optimisation ,1314798918,A discussion of techniques for improving OER discoverability by Peter Robinson.,0,,,1314798918,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/publications,1314184646,http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/publications,0,,,1314184646,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://ci.olnet.org/,1314806563,http://ci.olnet.org/,0,,,1314806563,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Bay Area Knowledge Exchange for Developmental Math (BAKE),1313410784,"A faculty team from the San Francisco Bay Area region community colleges, collaborating to mobilize knowledge, expertise and resources to enhance learning experiences and improve student success in Developmental Math (in affiliation with the CCC Success Network).

Authors contributing to the Encyclopedia give Stanford University the permission to publish the articles but retain the copyright to those articles.[1] As of January 20, 2011, the SEP has 1260 published entries. Apart from its online status, the encyclopedia uses the traditional academic approach of most encyclopedias and academic journals to achieve quality by means of peer reviews and specialist authors selected by an editor or an editorial committee which is competent (though not necessarily a specialist) in the field covered by the encyclopedia.

The encyclopedia was created in 1995 by Edward N. Zalta, with the explicit aim of providing a dynamic encyclopedia which is updated regularly, and so does not become dated in the manner of print encyclopedias. The charter for the encyclopedia allows for rival articles on a single topic to reflect reasoned disagreements amongst scholars. The SEP was initially developed with U.S. public funding from the NEH and NSF. A long-term fundraising plan to preserve open access to the Encyclopedia is supported by many university libraries and library consortia.

This panel will address key issues and provide empirically-grounded insights on learning about, with, and through open educational resources (OER). Open educational resources are educational materials that are freely shared by those who seek to learn and those who seek to teach. OERs are viewed by many as a revolutionary idea that could create more accessible, equitable education on a global scale; yet, the benefits and challenges of OER adoption in practice are not yet understood. Many OER initiatives are pursuing a vision of education as a 'public good', and international policy agendas on education are shifting from the idea of simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating 'Open Participatory Learning Ecosystems'; these efforts have outpaced our understanding of how educational systems behave when they become more open. Open education requires further empirical investigation. Each of the individuals on this panel brings expertise that speaks not only to understanding the potential value of OER, but also to understanding barriers and challenges of OER adoption. Speakers will cover issues on:
â€“ Advocacy, policy & development of OER
â€“ Social interfaces and the design of participation
â€“ Mentoring and peer learning in Open Education environments
â€“ Popular perceptions about OER, and attitudes towards sharing and creating OER content",0,,,1314890223,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+29,Open Educational Resource Components in Select Federal Grant Programs,1315594226,"This document contains a chart that captures Open Educational Resource components in select federal grant programs.

Since 2007:

* The AAP has spent over $3 million while the NACS has spent just around $90,000.

* The AAP has lobbied 37 different bills while the NACS has lobbied 38 different bills

Conceptualising collaborative participation and engagement for learning and creativity in OER communities. In: OER10 Conference, 22-24 March 2010, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) enable educational and cultural institutions to rethink and experiment with their conduct of learning using digital social media and networking tools. Meanwhile, several well-known â€“ yet distinct â€“ initiatives within the OER world continue to purport a mission of education as a â€˜public goodâ€™. In addition current thinking as well as emerging United Kingdom (UK) and international policy agendas on education are shifting from the idea of simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating â€˜open participatory learning ecosystemsâ€™ (cf. Smith and Casserly, 2006; Seely-Brown 2007; Seely-Brown & Adler 2008). At the core of these evolutionary trajectories of OER mediation, the notion of community and participation become more complex. Put simply, an OER community might consist of those who collaborate to create or reuse OER content. Alternatively a community may be formed by interactions between tutors and peers aggregating in the study and creative adaptation of particular OER units. Likewise, as the landscape of OER becomes more diversified (comprising of initiatives coming from both established educational institutions and from â€˜alternativeâ€™ or informal social constellations of interest and practice), so does the configuration of social production of content in learning environments. The question then arises as to the appropriateness of community building tools or mediating artefacts that address different audiencesâ€™ inscriptions or goals to facilitate engagement. To address these questions we first chart definitions of, and affordances surrounding participation and community engagement in a diverse body of OER initiatives. Secondly, deploying EngestrÃ¶mâ€™s framework on social production as a new landscape for learning (2007), we draw on a number of interviews with OER professionals and volunteers as well as on insights on learner behaviour to offer a mapping of learning situations across â€˜informalâ€™/â€™formalâ€™ public spaces. We conclude by problematising the notion of collaborative communities or â€˜relational networksâ€™ within an OER context and by proposing a framework that takes into account a number of boundary issues concerning design of original and OER content (Wilson, 2007), and peer-production of content, including expertise, locus of agency and pedagogy (Conole et al., in press).",0,,,1314797375,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://wikieducator.org/Empire_State_College/New_York%27s_open_university_joins_forces_with_the_OERu,1316613185,http://wikieducator.org/Empire_State_College/New_York%27s_open_university_joins_forces_with_the_OERu,0,,,1316613185,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,YouTube has added the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) as a licensing option for users,1311258636,"In conjunction with the implementation, YouTube has launched a Creative Commons video library containing 10,000 videos under CC BY from organizations such as C-SPAN, PublicResource.org, Voice of America, and Al Jazeera.

Recent advances in ICTs have enabled educational institutions to rethink and experiment with the ways in which they conduct learning using digital social media. Meanwhile, various initiatives within the Open Education Resource (OER) movement have been launched since the early 2000s, to create building blocks that would engage educational, cultural institutions and ordinary publics in providing access to, and repurposing of, free content, ranging from courseware to academic resources, from pedagogical designs to instructional learning archives (e.g. Atkins et al., 2007; OECD, 2007; JISC, 2009). With several well-known â€“ yet distinct â€“ initiatives continuing to purport a mission of education as a â€˜public goodâ€™, and current thinking as well as emerging UK and international policy agendas on education shifting from the idea of simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating â€˜Open Participatory Learning Ecosystemsâ€™ (e.g. Seely-Brown & Adler 2008), the mediation of open education requires further theoretical exploration.

Combining notions of â€˜institutional mediationâ€™ articulated by activity theory (e.g. EngestrÃ¶m, 1993; EngestrÃ¶m et al., 2003) with sociocultural perspectives (e.g. Thompson, 2005; Silverstone, 2005; Livingstone, 2009) the paper considers the meaning of Open Educational Resources (OERs) as participatory learning media (cf. Dalsgaard, 2008). Drawing on textual analyses, and a number of interviews with stakeholders from higher education institutions, policy advocates and members from popular community initiatives, a working typology of OERs is proposed. The paper argues that the multiple articulations of â€˜mediated learningâ€™ and (global) â€˜learning mediaâ€™, framing the socio-technical affordances and OERs, hinder many tensions pertaining the definition of openness, the nature of participation and indeed the purpose, legitimacy and quality of such resources.",0,,,1314795494,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Open-Access Textbooks and Financial Sustainability: A Case Study on Flat World Knowledge (2011),1315577882,"Hilton., J. & Wiley, D.

Drawing on sociocultural discourse analysis and argumentation theory, we motivate a focus on learners' discourse as a promising site for identifying patterns of activity which correspond to meaningful learning and knowledge construction. However, software platforms must gain access to qualitative information about the rhetorical dimensions to discourse contributions to enable such analytics. This is difficult to extract from naturally occurring text, but the emergence of more-structured annotation and deliberation platforms for learning makes such information available.

Three main points made:
As the world becomes more open, universities have the opportunity to embrace openness in how they carry out their operations, teaching, and research. 
Open educational resources can provide the catalyst for different forms of learning, linking formal and informal aspects and splitting up the functions of content, support, assessment, and accreditation. 
Models from research suggest that an open approach is likely to encourage the crossing of boundaries between inside and outside the classroom, games and tools for learning, and the amateur and the expert. A new attitude toward research and scholarship is needed to work with the data of openness and to use it as an approach to gather evidence, share thoughts, and disseminate results.",0,,,1328620545,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data137108251921190284340,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,http://code.google.com/edu/,1313759949,http://code.google.com/edu/,0,,,1313759949,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Web-based social software can be used to make qualitative data analysis of online peer-to-peer learning experiences,1314891101,Network visualization and analysis can be used to gather a better understanding of the peer-to-peer learning experience,0,,,1314891101,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Claim1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,"What strategies, investments, business models, policies can be devised to secure the future of the OER movement?",1341416192,,0,,,1341416192,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1.37108E+32,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,"A positive disposition towards the reuse and sharing of learning resources, together with an essentially collaborative outlook, are essential prerequisites for teachersâ€™ uptake of OER.",1315314616,"A positive disposition towards the reuse and sharing of learning resources, together with an essentially collaborative outlook, are essential prerequisites for teachersâ€™ uptake of OER.

Overall objectives:

1. Provide capacity building in Public Health for those working in low- to middle-income countries who would otherwise not be able to access such education, via Internet based e-learning

2. Utilise a 'social model' of capacity building, with volunteer academic and support staff and Open Educational Resources available through the Internet, using a collaborative approach and modern Information and Communication Technology

3. Offer education at the 'train the trainers' level, equivalent to that of a Masters degree, for those with prior educational and occupational experience

4. The education will meet identified competences which help with the evidence based practice of Public Health and be action oriented, to assist in tackling major health problems facing the populations in which the students work

5. Create an educational portfolio leading to a Certificate and Diploma in Public Health based on being shown to have met the competences identified in 4 or 8 of the course modules respectively, and an upgrade to the Masters of Public Health based on further work.

In essence, the choices boil down to:

    * If you are looking for a repository to store the OER's and make them available to the world, then you can contact ARIADNE or Connexions who will gladly do so on your behalf or provide you with the code to run your own repository.
    * If you have your own repository, then we strongly suggest that you make your content and metadata available for harvesting. As an alternative or in addition, you can also make your repository available for federated search. We strongly suggest that you register your repository
    * For your content, we make no specific assumptions: HTML documents, OpenOffice documents, Microsoft Office documents, MPEG video clips, PDF documents, MP3 sound files, etc.; anything goes. Of course, in the spirit of open educational resources, we certainly encourage you to publish in as open a format as feasible.
    * For the metadata, we strongly suggest to use either Learning Object Metadata or Dublin Core. For specific niche domains, other formats like for instance MPEG apply as well. You may also define a so-called 'application profile' that defines your specific requirements your repository imposes with respect to metadata, so that you can enforce them. In concrete terms, such metadata can be expressed as XML or RDF.

Meanwhile, several well-known â€“ yet distinct â€“ initiatives within the OER world continue to purport a mission of education as a â€˜public goodâ€™. In addition current thinking as well as emerging United Kingdom (UK) and international policy agendas on education are shifting from the idea of simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating â€˜open participatory learning ecosystemsâ€™. At the core of these evolutionary trajectories of OER mediation, the notion of community and participation become more complex.

In this paper we look at how a web-based social software can be used to make qualitative data analysis of online peer-to-peer learning experiences. Specifically, we propose to use Cohere, a web-based social sense-making tool, to observe, track, annotate and visualize discussion group activities in online courses. We define a specific methodology for data observation and structuring, and present results of the analysis of peer interactions conducted in discussion forum in a real case study of a P2PU course. Finally we discuss how network visualization and analysis can be used to gather a better understanding of the peer-to-peer learning experience.

This paper explores how learning design and peer behaviour develops and evolves in a free, open online learning community, the Peer-to-peer university (P2PU). Drawing on ideas relating to 'participatory learning' (Seely-Brown and Adler, 2008), it begins with a theoretical discussion of the ways in which the infrastructural and the social dimensions of peer learning are expressed in terms of the design of three courses, and in relation to mentoring and peer interaction. Evident from the textual interface and social organization of the three courses is that the role of the instructor or course organizer adheres a cooperative model (Burge, 1994), reflected in the aggregation and filtering of materials and the evolution of pedagogical modeling. While the models of participation and engagement vary, depending on socio-technical factors, evident is that the governance model allows both for light models of involvement and the evolution of inquiry towards what we would like to call 'distributed' mentoring. We conclude with an evaluation of the ways in which the courses under study promote a participatory infrastructure, that not only can make the process of learning transparent, but also represent a relationship between teaching and learning in an open fashion.",0,,,1314889884,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,1.37108E+29,1.37108E+30,Open education requires further empirical investigation.,1314890222,"Many OER initiatives are pursuing a vision of education as a 'public good', and international policy agendas on education are shifting from the idea of simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating 'Open Participatory Learning Ecosystems'; these efforts have outpaced our understanding of how educational systems behave when they become more open.

Lopez, responding to whatâ€™s driving OER, thought K-12 teachers are more interested in digital resources because their students want them. In higher education, the ability to re-mix resources is an important driver. And in both cases, (perceived low) cost is a driver.

education and training&quot;. OpenScout is a project co-funded by the European Commission within the eContentplus Programme as a Targeted Project in the area of Educational Content &#40;Grant ECP 2008 EDU 428016&#41;. OpenScout started in September 2009 and has a duration of three years.
 


OpenScout aims at providing an education service in the internet that enables users to easily find, access, use and exchange open content for management education and training.
 
OpenScout can be used by learners directly but also by training and education institutions that search for learning content to be integrated into their learning offerings.

 
 
The management education market is largely diversified, training topics range from general management and leadership to very specific issues like managing risks in banking industry. Despite the resulting growing need for management education and content the potential of already existing open learning materials is hardly exploited, neither in the business sector nor in SMEs where the need for lifelong learning is even greater.
 
To reduce the usage barriers OpenScout offers easy-to-use skill-based federated search and retrieval web services, provides an openly accessible tool library for improvement and re-publishing of open contents and establishes an open user community that opens up their content and adopts OpenScout web services in real contexts of use.

Keep Assignments Smallâ€”Break content assignments into manageable chunks to better assure completion and timeliness.

Support Both Online and Face-to-Face Mechanismsâ€”Projects that promote or facilitate face-to-face meeting spaces alongside their online peer production platform will likely benefit from increased content contributions from authors.

Set Up Two-Way Communication Channelsâ€” Two-way, as opposed to top-down, management driven communication channels serve to support community engagement and continuous improvement of the content creation process as project participants are              	more likely to offer feedback for improvements, both informal and formal.

Allow for Peer Pressureâ€”The group effect works. Authors who work together, especially in face-to-face settings, support one anotherâ€™s productivity and motivation.

The Dutch government's purpose in founding the Dutch Open Universiteit was to make higher education accessible to anyone with the necessary aptitudes and interests, regardless of formal qualifications.

Mission
The Open Universiteit in the Netherlands develops, provides and promotes innovative higher distance education of top quality, in collaboration with networks and alliances. As the prime university for lifelong learning, it addresses the wide-ranging learning needs of people during their course of life, plus the need to achieve a considerable increase of the knowledge level of the community at large.
We seek to be an institution that is strongly anchored in the Dutch higher education system through its educational, research and innovation activities, and that also operates successfully in the field of lifelong learning. We consider our institution to be a pioneer in open higher distance education and a leader in educational innovation, both in the Netherlands and internationally.

This situation is exacerbated by efforts of certain publishers &#40;called â€œprovidersâ€ù&#41; to acquire, bundle, and increase the pricing on journals.

Harvardâ€™s annual cost for journals from these providers now approaches $3.75M. In 2010, the comparable amount accounted for more than 20% of all periodical subscription costs and just under 10% of all collection costs for everything the Library acquires. Some journals cost as much as $40,000 per year, others in the tens of thousands. Prices for online content from two providers have increased by about 145% over the past six years, which far exceeds not only the consumer price index, but also the higher education and the library price indices. These journals therefore claim an ever-increasing share of our overall collection budget. Even though scholarly output continues to grow and publishing can be expensive, profit margins of 35% and more suggest that the prices we must pay do not solely result from an increasing supply of new articles.&quot;",0,,,1335283918,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,3.71522E+29,1.37108E+30,Sharing knowledge of policies leads to collective success,1336490802,"The open movement is reaching a stage where weâ€™ve had some real, concrete OER policy victories and there is the potential to achieve many more.

The project will dramatically reduce textbook costs and allow collaborative improvement of course design to improve student success.

While the project is quite complex, there are four key attributes that define the approach:

Kaleidoscope is a cross-institutional collaboration. The Kaleidoscope course designs are created by cross-institutional teams. Each course design is being developed by at least two partner institutions, and will be adopted by faculty members from other colleges.
Kaleidoscope course designs use the best of existing open educational resources (OER). Rather than adding to the wealth of existing OER, the faculty teams are assessing and leveraging existing OER. Where adequate open resources exist, we will not include commercial textbooks or materials in the course design.
Kaleidoscope course designs use a common assessment process. The course designs are created with assessment embedded throughout allowing faculty teams to understand where the course design is supporting student success, and where opportunities for improvement exist. The courses designs also enable rubric-based assessment of deeper learning outcomes.
Project Kaleidoscope will close the loop on improved course design and student learning. Using OER and a common assessment process will allow faculty teams to improve the course design and learning results based on analysis of embedded assessments and deeper learning results. Actually, the project requires this on-going, iterative review and improvement.
The partner institutions will complete initial Kaleidoscope course designs and pilot the courses in Fall 2011. Enhancements to these courses will be implemented in Spring 2012.

There are 50 million K-12 students in public schools in the U.S.

K-12 school publishingâ€”including elementary and high school textbooks and other teaching materialsâ€”is the second-largest publishing category in the U.S. after trade. Net sales revenue was $5.5 billion in 2010, according to the Association of American Publishers. &#40;K-12 publishing net sales revenue fell 12.4 percent between 2008 and 2009, but increased by 7.1 percent between 2009 and 2010. Overall, net sales revenue between 2008 and 2010 declined by 6.2 percent.&#41;

How is the K-12 publishing market different from trade and higher-ed publishing?

The main difference is that state governments and school districts procure about 90 percent of the books. â€œItâ€™s very much unlike the consumer market where we decide to go into Barnes &amp;amp; Noble &#40;NYSE: BKS&#41; and buy a book,â€ù says Jay Diskey, executive director of the AAPâ€™s school division. â€œA school district will decide it needs a new reading program for its elementary school students and will request proposals from publishers. If the state likes the proposal, the contract is negotiated.â€ù

Publishers donâ€™t always sell the books individually; a parent may not be able to buy a single textbook, for instance. The AAP notes the average net unit price of a K-12 title was $65 in 2010, but extensive pricing data is difficult to obtain because so many books are bought in bulk by state governments and school districts.

Learners accessing OER can acquire knowledge formally or informally. This project reports on assessment and accreditation policies worldwide.

A major function of colleges and universities is to validate and credentialise learning by conferring qualifications and degrees. They are well equipped and experienced in the process of assessing the quality of learning for formal academic or professional credit. However, digital media are transforming the ways individuals create, share and learn both formally and informally from content and applications available on the web. There is considerable ambiguity regarding the validity of this type of learning or self-study online and the use of individualized learning paths. The problem is that learners who access OER on the Web and do acquire knowledge and skills either formally or informally, alone or in groups, cannot readily have their learning assessed and subsequently receive appropriate academic recognition for their efforts. So, there is a need for ongoing research in order to understand the different ways that institutions are addressing the needs of this growing learner population.
This paper will report on a Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research project. The project is original in that it will research existing and nascent international protocols and practices leading to formal academic credit for non-traditional learners. This provides a framework to evaluate the transferability and applicability of these means for assessing OER learning on the web leading to formal credentials. Existing organisational and policy barriers will be identified and categorized. The project proposes a conceptual framework to overcome these barriers for widening access to post-secondary education through digital learning in ways, which are more accessible cost-effective and responsive to the diverse, changing needs of the knowledge economy and society.
This research is significant because the core mission of any modern university is to contribute to society. Many universities incorporate the mission of community service, as publicly funded institutions, to serve the wider interests of society by sharing expertise and scholarship. An understanding of how different institutions are approaching the recognition of non-formal and informal digital learning can provide change agents with new knowledge on how to expand their community service and learning missions by creating flexible pathways to credentialise learning for non-traditional students.
Recent transformational advances in digital media, the web and mobile devices have changed the learning landscape, ensuring that this research project is different. The exponential increase in accessibility to quality educational as OER provides unprecedented opportunities for learning. Thousands of course modules are presently available online, as OER from respected institutions, along with millions of websites that can be used to support a wide variety of learning objectives. This exponential growth has opened up opportunities for learners leading to potential obligations from our institutions.
The UNESCO/COL Chair has partners on all continents. This project will contribute to the advancement of knowledge of the assessment of learning experience for non-traditional learners. The outputs of this research could potentially have wide social impact in expanding access to learning opportunities for those students currently under-served by the formal sector while enhancing the efficiency of taxpayer funded institutions by refining existing mechanisms for assessment and accreditation or non-traditional learners.",0,,,1327263038,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Case Study8413224870340368001327255684,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,8.41322E+27,8.41322E+27,Open ACCREDITATION infrastructure will emerge,1327263381,"New infrastructures &#40;people&#43;policies&#43;practices&#43;technologies&#41; will emerge to enable accreditation, expanding beyond formal institutions",0,,,1327263381,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Solution8413224870340368001327255684,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,8.41322E+27,8.41322E+27,**Missing**,1327256029,What Apple Is Wading Into: A Snapshot Of The K-12 Textbook Business,0,,,1327256029,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Web Resource8413224870340368001327255684,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,8.71123E+28,1.37108E+30,http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2006/06/perspective_the_pros_and_cons.html,1314353795,http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2006/06/perspective_the_pros_and_cons.html,0,,,1314353795,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Reference1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,8.71123E+28,1.37108E+30,The pros and cons of open review,1314353793,"Thomas De Coursey reflects on his experiences of Open Review in this blog post.

This is similar to the member/editor system used by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The member reviewing a manuscript is identified to the authors only if and when the paper is accepted for publication.

We canâ€™t make it so no students in a class have a tech-rich learning experience because some students have difficulty with access.

One had to be careful and spend those resources on articles that were likely to be worth it, and even then restrict what was spent on individual articles by imposing maximum lengths and the like. Also, finding the articles worth reading was difficult and the choices and guidance journal editors and editorial boards made were welcome.

How all this has changed with the advent of the Web. There is hardly any need for restrictions on the number and length of articles anymore, and searching â€“ not to mention finding â€“ articles that are relevant to the specific project a researcher is working on has become dramatically easier. As a result, the filtering and selecting functions of journals have become rather redundant.&quot;

This includes providing training for instructors adopting open resources, peer reviews of open textbooks, and mentoring online professional networks that support for authors opening their resources, and other services.

The initiatives and leadership of College Open Textbooks are driven by member organizations including Benetech Bookshare, California Community Colleges Chancellorâ€™s Office, Carnegie Mellon University, Community College for Open Educational Resources, Foothill De Anza Community College District, Flat World Knowledge, Florida Distance Learning Consortium, Happy About, Inc., Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME), League of Innovation, Macmillan Dynamic Books, MERLOT, Open Education Resources Center for California, Rice University Connexions, Textbook Media, Virtual Ability, and Words & Numbers.

The focus of these efforts could save students millions of dollars by increasing the number of open high-quality textbooks available online as alternatives to expensive printed textbooks sold by publishers.

Key highlights of the initiative include:

1.) A campaign to raise the awareness about open textbooks among community college instructors, students and authors as well as to state legislators.

2.)Increasing the role of advocacy by providing online and peer communities that will provide Train the Trainer programs and a repository of reusable training and marketing materials for them to use in their roles as evangelists and advocates at their colleges.
    
3.)Increase the use of open textbook adoptions in key disciplines such as math.

4.)Create an easy-to-use central repository for toolsets that can be shared amongst the peer communities and initiatives created to promote and support open textbook adoption.

education organisations have an important role to play in international adoption of OER,1315568644,"The following policy suggestions were made at the UNESCO Policy Forum (2010) that was attended by participants from 60 member countries focused on raising policy awareness of OER. While the suggestions relate to UNESCO, they may be applicable to other/similar organizations.

The groups considered that UNESCO:

â€¢ is ideally placed to foster a brokering role on multiple levels (from institution through to regional and international) and also in subject?based communities and to promote OER in the international context. The focus should now also be changing to the re?use and identification of OER and not just on the development of OER.

â€¢ should be driving an international agenda by persuading governments (at political and decision?making levels) to change the quality of teaching and learning through the use of OER. The adoption of OER could lead to significant cost savings in the education budgets thereby freeing up funds for other projects.

â€¢ should not only continue raising awareness but should be partnering with â€œinformation movementsâ€ù to convert policies into implementation plans.

â€¢ needs to ensure that it â€œwalks the talkâ€ù by ensuring that its own publications are released as OER. 

â€¢ has a central role to play in sharing experiences, creating thematical discussion points, providing guidelines and suggested models.

â€¢ could make case studies available, not as academic publications but rather as â€œadvocacy through storiesâ€ù, that can be shared through networks.

â€¢ has a crucial role to play by adding its voice to discussions around international and national copyright laws.",0,,,1315568644,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Data1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11252E+29,1.37108E+30,OER can expose students to resources developed by others which will enhance their learning experience,1315567235,\OER can expose students to resources developed by others which will enhance their learning experience," but this requires a culture change in course preparation and learning design.\""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Suggestion made at the UNESCO Policy Forum (2010) that was attended by participants from 60 member countries focused on raising policy awareness of OER.""",0,,,1315567235,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Solution1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11252E+29,1.37108E+30,OER is not just for open universities but can be used for any university,1315567343,Suggestion made at the UNESCO Policy Forum (2010) that was attended by participants from 60 member countries focused on raising policy awareness of OER.,0,,,1315567343,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Solution1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11252E+29,1.37108E+30,The negative impact due to the proliferation of content and the possibility of resources that are lacking in quality and credibility could interfere with access to better quality resources,1315566837,Challenge raised at the UNESCO Policy Forum (2010) that was attended by participants from 60 member countries focused on raising policy awareness of OER.,0,,,1315566837,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Issue1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11252E+29,1.37108E+30,Publishers will need to adapt their current practices in line with OER principles in order to survive,1315567964,Suggestion made at the UNESCO Policy Forum (2010) that was attended by participants from 60 member countries focused on raising policy awareness of OER.,0,,,1315568038,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Claim1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11254E+28,1.37108E+30,"In California, New York and Nebraska, faculty members are collaborating on open general education courses that will cut student textbook costs to less than $30 per class",1320923840,Greater collaboration and improved sharing of expertise and resources can push down the cost of producing open materials.,0,,,1320923840,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Solution1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11254E+28,1.37108E+30,What kind of policies should apply to K-12 textbooks?,1320922078,"What can the state do to better serve students, teachers and taxpayers?",0,,,1320922078,cohere,N,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Issue1371081452500591783001302877619,NULL,,,,,,,,,,,,9.11254E+28,1.37108E+30,Commerical publishers have too much influence over policy,1320314565,\A provision in the proposed House of Representatives budget for fiscal year 2012 would stop the federal government from using grant programs to develop new courses," learning materials or other related projects unless the labor secretary verifies that similar programs are not already available for purchase or â€œunder development.â€ù\""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"\""Money that would have gone to creating open materials for community colleges ended up getting axed from the 2009 American Graduation Initiative.
